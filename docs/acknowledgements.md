This course is a fork of the original course "Programming Practices for Research in Economics."
We concentrate more heavily on tools centered on reproducibility, and the use of the R programming language.

Our current course is designed after and borrows a lot from:

* [Effective Programming Practices for Economists](http://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/teaching.html#effective-programming-practices-for-economists-msc-phd), a course by [Hans-Martin von Gaudecker](http://www.wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/index.html).
* [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
* [Programming Practices for Research in Economics, 2017 Edition](https://pp4rs.github.io/2017-uzh)
